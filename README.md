# bookbot

bookbot is my first git project. It is a Python CLI program for generating simple reports on documents or books.

## Usage

Inside the directory containing bookbot, the program expects a subdirectory named books. Running it will generate and print a report on any *.txt file titled 'book.txt' within this subdirectory. 
See expected path below.

## Expected Path

```bash
./books/book.txt
```
